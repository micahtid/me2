## Overview
Me2 was a chat app built exclusively for students. The goal was to create an online space for students to connect. The app included a feature that matched students based on their interests and coursework. You could send private messages to your matches, join a global chat for general discussions, or jump into a subject-specific study room that used Zoom.

## Vulnerabilities
- Inconsistent chat room closure, sometimes displaying inaccurate duration timers
- Instances of users being incorrectly displayed as online

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Firebase  
- **Integration:** Zoom API
